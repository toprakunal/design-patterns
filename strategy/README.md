# Strategy Design Pattern
  Assume that we have an application that simulates ducks. It contains a variety of duck species and behaviors like quacking, swimming, and flying. These behaviors are varies like some ducks can't even fly, and some of them squeak. we encapsulate these behaviors.

The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Principles

- Encapsulate what varies.
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Program to interfaces, not implementations
